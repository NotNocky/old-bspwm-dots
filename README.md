.xresources and font sizes in general will be quite large. this is because i have trouble reading default dpi on the screen at 1080p in 13in its an easy fix if you want to use something similar for a desktop or larger screen But i highly recomend doing it yourself

using a picom fork {https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/fs8trg/oc_comptonpicom_fork_with_both_tryone144s_dual/}
for better blur

batt script in polybar is specifcally for this laptop tho should work for similar dual battery laptops {keep in mind the icons are inside the script not the polybar config}

polybar colors are hard coded because i dont use pywal if you want to use pywal colors in polybar {https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/wiki/Customization#polybar}

Ill update this often and as i change my dot files. do not expect this to stay the same

Wallpapers are available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LVlYHzyFQ1vHvHAKT4yWaV4HbF9XLFbX?usp=sharing at the moment theres no sources and im not confident they are the best available quality Ill update this as i get around to it.
